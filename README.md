Sprint 1 Name prompts

Create a new Repo with a README.md and clone to your local machine
Use a total of 4 'prompt' or 'confirm' functions to collect user input
Store users responses in separate variables
Use an 'alert' to concatenate the users responses into a single statement
Create a console.log() to print each question and response
In the HTML portion of the file, place the four questions within a series of tags so that they are listed on the screen.
